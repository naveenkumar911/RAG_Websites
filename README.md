Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) System
Overview
The Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system is designed to provide answers to user queries by extracting and retrieving information from specified web sources. This project incorporates a combination of retrieval-based and generative AI techniques to ensure accurate and reliable answers.

Key features include:

Automated data extraction and indexing from web links.
A RESTful API with endpoints for content indexing and question-answering.
Accurate citations for each response to reference the original source.
Scalable deployment with Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipeline.
Bonus: Minimal UI for user interaction.

Setup Instructions
1. Prerequisites
Python 3.9+
Docker installed on your system.
Kubernetes cluster (optional, for cloud deployment).
Redis or other vector database for content storage.
API key (if authentication is enabled).
2. Installation
Local Environment
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rag-system.git
cd rag-system
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Start the API:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Access the API at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Using Docker
Build the Docker image:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t rag-system .
Run the container:

bash
Copy code
docker run -p 8000:8000 rag-system
Access the API at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Using Docker Compose
Start the services:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up
Access the API at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Using Kubernetes
Deploy to your Kubernetes cluster:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f deployments/kubernetes-deployment.yml
Monitor the deployment:

bash
Copy code
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services
Access the API using the external IP of the LoadBalancer service.

3. API Usage
Indexing Content
Endpoint: POST /api/v1/index

Sample Request:

json
Copy code
{
  "url": ["https://example.com/article"]
}
Sample Response:

json
Copy code
{
  "status": "success",
  "indexed_url": ["https://example.com/article"],
  "failed_url": null
}
Chat with the System
Endpoint: POST /api/v1/chat

Sample Request:

json
Copy code
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "content": "What are extrinsic hallucinations?",
      "role": "user"
    }
  ]
}
Sample Response:

json
Copy code
{
  "response": {
    "answer": {
      "content": "Extrinsic hallucinations occur when...",
      "role": "assistant"
    },
    "citation": ["https://example.com/article"]
  }
}
4. Deployment
Deployment Steps
Docker:

Build the image:
bash
Copy code
docker build -t rag-system .
Push to DockerHub:
bash
Copy code
docker tag rag-system <your-dockerhub-username>/rag-system:latest
docker push <your-dockerhub-username>/rag-system:latest
Kubernetes:

Update kubernetes-deployment.yml with your DockerHub image.
Deploy:
bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f deployments/kubernetes-deployment.yml
CI/CD Pipeline:

Configure your GitHub Actions using deployments/github-actions.yml.
Push to the main branch to trigger automated testing and deployment.
5. User Interface
Run the UI:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run ui/app.py
Access the UI at http://127.0.0.1:8501.

6. Testing
Run unit tests:

bash
Copy code
pytest tests/
Future Improvements
